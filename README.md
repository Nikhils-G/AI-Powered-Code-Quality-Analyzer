## Features
- **Java Parsing**: 
  - Utilizes ANTLR to parse Java code and generate its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This allows for deeper analysis of the code structure and semantics.
- **Code Quality Analysis**:
  - Employs static analysis techniques to detect various issues, including:
    - Unused variables and methods
    - Redundant code and dead code
    - Anti-patterns and complex code constructs
    - Suggests improvements to enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Machine Learning Suggestions**:
  - A trained ML model offers code improvement recommendations based on a database of known best practices. This allows for context-aware suggestions tailored to the specific coding style and structure.
- **Complexity Analysis**:
  - Computes cyclomatic complexity metrics to assess code maintainability, highlighting areas that may require refactoring to simplify understanding and reduce the potential for bugs.
- **Testing Suite**:
  - An integrated JUnit testing suite validates the effectiveness of the analyzer's recommendations, ensuring that suggested changes do not introduce new issues into the codebase.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: 
  - The primary programming language, leveraging its robust ecosystem and libraries.
- **ANTLR**:
  - A powerful parser generator that enables the creation of parsers for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files.
- **Weka/DL4J**: 
  - Libraries used for implementing machine learning algorithms. Weka is great for classification, regression, and clustering tasks, while DL4J supports deep learning models.
- **JUnit**:
  - A widely used testing framework in Java that facilitates test-driven development (TDD) and ensures code correctness through automated testing.

---

## Requirements
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 11 or higher:
  - Ensure you have the latest JDK installed to avoid compatibility issues.
- **ANTLR** (version 4.x):
  - Required for generating the parser classes necessary for code analysis.
- **Machine Learning Library**:
  - Weka is recommended for its ease of use and comprehensive algorithms; alternatively, DL4J can be used for advanced deep learning functionalities.
- **JUnit**:
  - Essential for running the testing suite to validate functionality.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/AI-Code-Quality-Analyzer.git
cd AI-Code-Quality-Analyzer
```

### Step 2: Install ANTLR
1. Download the ANTLR runtime JAR file from the [ANTLR website](https://www.antlr.org/download.html) and add it to your project's classpath.
2. Generate the parser classes from the `.g4` grammar files using the following commands:
   ```bash
   antlr4 JavaLexer.g4
   antlr4 JavaParser.g4
   ```

### Step 3: Install Machine Learning Libraries
1. **Weka**:
   - Download the Weka JAR from the [Weka website](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html).
   - Add the Weka JAR to your project's classpath.
2. **DL4J** (if preferred):
   - Follow the installation instructions available on the [DL4J GitHub page](https://deeplearning4j.konduit.ai/).

### Step 4: Set Up Environment
- Ensure your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) is configured with the necessary libraries and dependencies. Alternatively, you can set up the project using a build automation tool like Maven or Gradle.

## Usage

### Running the Code Quality Analyzer
To analyze a Java code snippet, follow these steps:

1. **Compile the Project**:
   Compile the project with the necessary dependencies included:
   ```bash
   javac -classpath ".:/path/to/antlr.jar:/path/to/weka.jar" *.java
   ```

2. **Execute the Analyzer**:
   Run the analyzer on a Java code snippet:
   ```bash
   java -classpath ".:/path/to/antlr.jar:/path/to/weka.jar" MainClass "YourJavaCodeHere"
   ```

### Example Command
```bash
java -classpath ".:/path/to/antlr.jar:/path/to/weka.jar" JavaCodeParser "public class Example { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println('Hello World'); } }"
```

### Expected Output
The output will provide:
- A parsing tree visualizing the structure of the input code.
- A list of detected inefficiencies, potential bugs, and anti-patterns.
- Suggested improvements generated from the machine learning model.
- A cyclomatic complexity score, indicating the maintainability of the code.
