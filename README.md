## Features
- **Java Parsing**: Uses ANTLR for parsing Java code and analyzing its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Code Quality Analysis**: Applies static analysis to detect inefficiencies, unused variables, redundant logic, and more.
- **Machine Learning for Code Suggestions**: Trained ML model suggests improvements based on code quality and best practices.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Calculates cyclomatic complexity to assess maintainability.
- **Testing Suite**: Integrated JUnit test suite for validating and benchmarking code quality enhancements.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Primary programming language.
- **ANTLR**: For parsing Java syntax and generating the AST.
- **Weka or DL4J**: Machine learning libraries for Java.
- **JUnit**: Testing framework for validating tool functionality.

---

## Requirements
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 11 or higher
- **ANTLR** (4.x)
- **Machine Learning Library**: Weka (recommended) or DL4J
- **JUnit**: For testing

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/AI-Code-Quality-Analyzer.git
cd AI-Code-Quality-Analyzer
```

### 2. Install ANTLR
Download the ANTLR runtime JAR file and add it to your project's classpath.

Generate the parser classes from `.g4` grammar files:
```bash
antlr4 JavaLexer.g4
antlr4 JavaParser.g4
```

### 3. Install Machine Learning Libraries
Install **Weka** or **DL4J** for the ML module. For Weka:
```bash
# Install Weka library (you may download the .jar from Weka's website)
# Add the Weka JAR to your project classpath
```

### 4. Set Up Environment
Ensure the project dependencies are properly configured in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) or via Maven/Gradle.

## Usage

### Running the Code Quality Analyzer
You can run the tool on any Java code snippet to receive quality scores, complexity analysis, and suggested improvements.

1. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   javac -classpath ".:/path/to/antlr.jar:/path/to/weka.jar" *.java
   ```

2. Run the Analyzer:
   ```bash
   java -classpath ".:/path/to/antlr.jar:/path/to/weka.jar" MainClass "YourJavaCodeHere"
   ```

### Sample Command
```bash
java -classpath ".:/path/to/antlr.jar" JavaCodeParser "public class Example { ... }"
```

The output will display:
- Parsing tree of the input code
- Detected inefficiencies or bugs
- Suggested improvements based on the ML model
- Cyclomatic complexity score

## Modules

### 1. Parsing Module
**ANTLR** is used to parse Java code and build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which allows detailed code structure analysis.

### 2. Code Quality Analysis
Applies static rules for detecting inefficient practices, unused variables, and redundant logic. Custom rules can be added to expand functionality.

### 3. Machine Learning for Code Suggestions
Uses an ML model trained on labeled code quality data to provide real-time suggestions for optimizing code performance and maintainability.

### 4. Complexity Analysis
Calculates cyclomatic complexity to measure code maintainability, readability, and the ease of understanding.

### 5. Testing Suite
JUnit tests validate the tool's functionality, ensuring that recommendations improve code quality without introducing errors.

## Architecture
The **AI-Powered Code Quality Analyzer** follows a modular architecture for scalability and maintainability. Key components include:
1. **Java Parsing (ANTLR)**: Parses code and generates the AST.
2. **Code Analysis Engine**: Analyzes AST to identify common inefficiencies.
3. **Machine Learning Model**: Predicts code quality and suggests improvements.
4. **Complexity Analyzer**: Assesses cyclomatic complexity for maintainability insights.
5. **User Interface (Optional)**: Future development may include a GUI using JavaFX.
